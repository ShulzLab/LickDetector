# LickDetector
Capacitive sensor with sensitivity adjustement to detect mouse licks

_____

The device is provided by [Sentronic](https://www.sentronic.com/) and comrpises two parts :

- The ``capacitive sensor`` :

______

The ``capacitive sensor`` plugs into the ``digititzer`` with a specific connector.

The polarity of the 3 wires for the digitizer are :

| Wire color | Rated voltage | Description    |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Black      | 0-5V (digital)| Signal Out     |
| Blue       | GND           | - / Ground     |
| Brown      | +12V          | + / Voltage In |

We usually remove the PTFE like (teflon, or white plastic) coating on top of the ``capacitive sensor`` with a scalpel blade (take care of your fingers !) and solder un the innermost circle at the center, a wire to "extend" the capacitive sensor wherever we like, for example around a glass tube, to serve as a lick-detector. Take care to have the least possible length of wire between what you want to measure and your ``capacitive sensor``, as a higher length will decrease the signal over "noise" ratio, and will make adjusting the sensitivity of the ``amplifier / digitizer`` to a stable value upon licks less easy/impossible.
